I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Waterloo, advised by <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/embedded-software-group/people-profiles/sebastian-fischmeister">Dr. Sebastian Fischmeister</a>. My research focuses partly on developing algorithms for the interpretation of machine learning models, and on the analysis of side-channels for intrusion detection in real-time safety-critical domain. I am particularly excited about grounding my research in interpreting the decision-making process of deep neural networks for time-series and images in the real-time and safety-critical domain.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
