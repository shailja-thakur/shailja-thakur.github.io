I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Waterloo, advised by [Dr. Sebastian Fischmeister](https://uwaterloo.ca/embedded-software-group/people-profiles/sebastian-fischmeister). My research focuses on developing algorithms for the analysis of side-channels for intrusion detection, anomaly detection and interpretability. I am particularly excited about grounding my research in the application relating to understanding the decision-making process of deep neural networks for time-series in the real-time and safety-critical domain.
